# Java Note
-C is a Procedure Oriented Programming Language
-Java is an Object Oriented Programming Language

- Obejcts mean real world things, real world entities.

## What is OOP?
-Writing programs to represent real world entities.
eg: C cannot represent real world objects. It only supports to represent behaviours/tasks. (can only write functions)
        -Java
        -Python
        -C#
        -C++
        -Kotlin

- once the installation is done, there will be 2 folders inside the Java Folder.
        JDK--> Java Development Kit(contains development and Debugging Tools)
        JRE--> Java Runtime Environment(provides the environment for the application to run. contains Java Virtual Machine, which supports to run the application)

## JAVA
- Intructions/codes are written on notepad
- no header files
- has main function
- case sensitive
- platform independent (the .class file can be run on any device)

- In JAVA, the function(we used in C) is called method.
- methods are used to execute instructions.

Eg: **Access modifier**+ class Main // public, private, protected are access modifiers. 
    {
        //curly brackets are separators
    }
*public variables are like global variables in C*
*. means = inside*



## Giving an Output

class Main
{ public static void main(String[] args) **<--- NO VALUE INSIDE SQ. BRACKETS MEANS UNLIMITED SIZE**
    {
        System.out.println("Hello OOP");
    }
}

.class files contain byte code. the source code is converted into byte code first and then JVM translates it into machine code. 
Tbh, byte code acts like an intermediary code.
