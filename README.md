# Java Note
-C is a Procedure Oriented Programming Language
-Java is an Object Oriented Programming Language

- Obejcts mean real world things, real world entities.

## What is OOP?
-Writing programs to represent real world entities.
eg: C cannot represent real world objects. It only supports to represent behaviours/tasks. (can only write functions)
        -Java
        -Python
        -C#
        -C++
        -Kotlin

- once the installation is done, there will be 2 folders inside the Java Folder.
        JDK--> Java Development Kit (contains development and Debugging Tools)
        JRE--> Java Runtime Environment (provides the environment for the application to run. contains Java Virtual Machine, which supports to run the application)

## JAVA
- Intructions/codes are written on notepad
- no header files
- has main function
- case sensitive
- platform independent (the .class file can be run on any device)

- In JAVA, the function(we used in C) is called method.
- methods are used to execute instructions.

Eg: **Access modifier**
```java
class Main // public, private, protected are access modifiers. 
    {
        //curly brackets are separators
    }
```
*public variables are like global variables in C*
  
*'.' means = inside*



## Giving an Output

```java
class Main
{ public static void main(String[] args) // NO VALUE INSIDE SQ. BRACKETS MEANS UNLIMITED SIZE**
    {
        System.out.println("Hello OOP");
    }
}
```

.class files contain byte code. the source code is converted into byte code first and then JVM translates it into machine code. 
Tbh, byte code acts like an intermediary code.

# Constructors
- Constructors are used to intialize object of the class when the object is created.
- JAVA requires a constructor call for every object that is created.
- a constructor is only used to set values.
### Ex:
```java
class Mask{
	private String color;
	private String size;
	private float price;

	public Mask(String color, String size, float price){

		this.color= color; 
		this.size = size;
		this.price = price;
        /* 	this means that value of color parameter in "Mask constructor"
			is assigned to the color attribute in "class Mask" value. */
}

}

class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
        Mask 1 = new Mask("red", "small", 50.00);
	}
}
```

# Instances and Statics

- Instances are non static variables which are defined in a class outside any method, constructor or a block. Each instanstiated object of the class has a seperate copy or instance of that variable.
- An instance variable belongs to a class.

###  Ex:
```java
    class Computer{
        private String brand;                    
        private static String color = "Black";   // this is a instance member. All objects created in this class can have a copy of this instance.
        public Computer(String brand){          // this is a static member, which means all the objects created under this class shares this same attribute.
        this.brand = brand;
    }

    public showDetails(){
        System.out.println("color is " + color);
        System.out.println("brand is " + brand);
    }
}
    class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Computer x = new Computer("HP);
        Computer y = new Computer("Dell");
        x.showDetails();
        y.showDetails();
    }
}
```
# Association

- Association in JAVA is a connection or relation between two seperate classes that are set up through their objects. (smh similar to Relationships in DBMS)

- Composition (HAS-A) simply mean the use of instance variables that are references to other objects. For example Maruti has Engine, or House has Bathroom.

    ## HAS-A Relationship/ Composition

            Ex:
            - A student has a module 
            - A driver has a vehicle
            - seller sells products


    <img src= "https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210119172523/HasARelationJavaExample.png">

```java
class Student {
    private String name;
    Module m1; // module class object created inside student class.
    public Student(String name){
        this.name = name;
        m1 = new Module(30); // Association
    }
    public void showDetails(){
        System.out.println("Name is " + name);
        // System.out.println("Module duration =" + duration);
        // (this line won't work as duration is a private attribute in another class)
        System.out.println("Module duration is " + m1.getDuration() );
    }
} 
class Module{
    private int duration;
    public Module(int duration){
        this.duration = duration; // Association
    }
    public int getDuration(){
        return duration;
    }
}
class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s1 = new Student("Pasindu");
        s1.showDetails();
    }
}
```

            -  < INHERITANCE
            -  < BENEFITS OF INHERITANCE
            -  < DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INHERITANCE AND ASSOCIATION
            -  < MODELS OF INHERITANCE

 ## IS-A Relationship/ Inheritance
    
    - Inheritance in Java is the method to create a hierarchy between classes by inheriting from other classes.
    
```java
class Furniture{
    public void display(){
        System.out.println("It is a furniture");
    }
    public void test(){
        System.out.println("It is testing");
    }
}
class Chair extends Furniture{
    //keyword "extends" is used to indicate that a class is inherited from another class.

    //TO BE NOTED: private attributes doesn't get inherited as it is defined under private label and only belongs to the specific class.
    {
        
    }
}
class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        // now you can call methods in Furniture class to the objects of Chair class.
        Chair c = new Chair();
        c.display();
        c.test();
    }
}
```
**TIP : The protected keyword in Java refers to one of its access modifiers. The methods or data members declared as protected can be accessed from**

    - Within the same class.
    - Subclasses of the same packages.
    - Different classes of the same packages.
    - Subclasses of different packages.

```java
class Product{
    protected float unit_price;
    public void setPrice(float unit_price){
        this.unit_price = unit_price;
    }
}
class LocalProdcut extends Product{
    private float discount_amt;
    public void setDiscount(float disc_amt);{
        this.discount_amt = disc_amt;
    }
    public void getLastPrice(){
        System.out.println("Last Price: " + (unit_price - disc_amt));
    }
}
class Main{
    public static void main(String [] args){
        LocalProduct lp = new LocalProduct();
        lp.setPrice(500.0f);
        lp.setDiscount(100.0f);
        lp.getLastPrice();
    }
}
```

# Polymorphism 

    - Using one name and doing several tasks ( one name + Many tasks)

    - There are two types of polymorphism in JAVA.
        1. Runtime Polymorphism (Overriding)
        2. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Overloading)

 ## 1. Runtime Polymorphism (Overriding)
    
```java
class Item{
    public void show()
    {
        System.out.println("This is an item");
    }
} 
class Computer extends Item{
    public void show() // method overrriding
    {
        System.out.println("This is a computer");
    }
}
class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Computer c1 = new Computer();
        c1.show();
    }
}
```
