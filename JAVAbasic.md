# Java Note
-C is a Procedure Oriented Programming Language
-Java is an Object Oriented Programming Language

- Obejcts mean real world things, real world entities.

## What is OOP?
-Writing programs to represent real world entities.
eg: C cannot represent real world objects. It only supports to represent behaviours/tasks. (can only write functions)
        -Java
        -Python
        -C#
        -C++
        -Kotlin

- once the installation is done, there will be 2 folders inside the Java Folder.
        JDK--> Java Development Kit (contains development and Debugging Tools)
        JRE--> Java Runtime Environment (provides the environment for the application to run. contains Java Virtual Machine, which supports to run the application)

## JAVA
- Intructions/codes are written on notepad
- no header files
- has main function
- case sensitive
- platform independent (the .class file can be run on any device)

- In JAVA, the function(we used in C) is called method.
- methods are used to execute instructions.

Eg: **Access modifier**
```java
class Main // public, private, protected are access modifiers. 
    {
        //curly brackets are separators
    }
```
*public variables are like global variables in C*
  
*'.' means = inside*



## Giving an Output

```java
class Main
{ public static void main(String[] args) // NO VALUE INSIDE SQ. BRACKETS MEANS UNLIMITED SIZE**
    {
        System.out.println("Hello OOP");
    }
}
```

.class files contain byte code. the source code is converted into byte code first and then JVM translates it into machine code. 
Tbh, byte code acts like an intermediary code.

# Constructors
- Constructors are used to intialize object of the class when the object is created.
- JAVA requires a constructor call for every object that is created.
- a constructor is only used to set values.
### Ex:
```java
class Mask{
	private String color;
	private String size;
	private float price;

	public Mask(String color, String size, float price){

		this.color= color; 
		this.size = size;
		this.price = price;
        /* 	this means that value of color parameter in "Mask constructor"
			is assigned to the color attribute in "class Mask" value. */
}

}

class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
        Mask 1 = new Mask("red", "small", 50.00);
	}
}
```

# Instances and Statics

- Instances are non static variables which are defined in a class outside any method, constructor or a block. Each instanstiated object of the class has a seperate copy or instance of that variable.
- An instance variable belongs to a class.

###  Ex:
```java
    class Computer{
        private String brand;                    
        private static String color = "Black";   // this is a instance member. All objects created in this class can have a copy of this instance.
        public Computer(String brand){          // this is a static member, which means all the objects created under this class shares this same attribute.
        this.brand = brand;
    }

    public showDetails(){
        System.out.println("color is " + color);
        System.out.println("brand is " + brand);
    }
}
    class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Computer x = new Computer("HP);
        Computer y = new Computer("Dell");
        x.showDetails();
        y.showDetails();
    }
}
```
